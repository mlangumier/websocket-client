A **Tic-Tac-Toe** game playable in **real-time** between two players via the browser.

This project uses **Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO** to manage player connections and game state.

For this part I worked only on : [index.html](index.html), [loading.gif](loading.gif), [public\client.js](public\client.js), [public\style.css](public\style.css), [server.cjs](server.cjs)

## First idea :

- I want a **tic tac toe** game for 2 players on 2 separate browers.
- Both browsers must synchronise when one player make a move.
- Sinon : Draw. Win condition: 3 X or 3 O align on the board.

## Server side :

- The server manages the matches and the game‚Äôs internal logic.
- When a player connects, they wait for an opponent. As soon as there are two players, a match begins.
- The server creates the board, assigns X and O, and keeps track of the current turn.
- Every move sent by a player is checked by the server: is the square empty? is it the correct turn?
- After each move, the server checks if someone has won or if it‚Äôs a draw.
- If the endgame conditions are not met, the turn passes to the next player.

## The client:

- The player enters their name, clicks ‚ÄúSearch,‚Äù and waits for an opponent to connect.
- When the match begins, the client displays the board and information: opponent‚Äôs name, symbol (X or O), and whose turn it is.
- When the player clicks on a square, the client sends this move to the server.
- When the server returns the board state, the client updates the display: played squares, next turn, and X/O styling.
- When the match ends, the client shows who won or if it‚Äôs a tie, and reloads the page for a new game.
- The server makes all decisions to prevent cheating and keeps control of the game.
- The client sends actions to the server and displays updates sent by the server.

[Client1] <--click--> [Server] <--update--> [Client1 & Client2]

[End condition not met] --> [Next turn]

[Client2] <--click--> [Server] <--update--> [Client1 & Client2]

## Design choices:

- X always starts; turns alternate automatically.
- All win and draw checks are handled on the server side.
- The client only handles display and sending clicks.
- If a player quits, the other is notified and the match ends.

# Install

**Run**:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mlangumier/websocket-client/tree/test-separation-logic-ameliah

# Navigate to the project folder
cd test-separation-logic-ameliah

# Install dependencies
npm install -g express http nodemon socket.io 

# Start the server
nodemon server.cjs

# Ouvrir 2 fen√™tres sur :
# http://localhost:8080
```

## ‚ö° Express

  
**What is it?** A light framework for Node.js.

**Role in this project:**

Serves/send static files (HTML, CSS, JS) to the browser.
Creates simple routes, to display the game page.

**Connection to WebSockets:** Express doesn‚Äôt handle real-time communication by itself, but it provides the server base for Socket.IO to run on.

  
## üîÉ Socket.IO

  
**What is it?** A Node.js library that enables real-time communication between the server and browsers.
  
**Role in this project:**

Lets both players see moves instantly.  
Manages events like ‚Äúplayer joined‚Äù, ‚Äúmove played‚Äù, ‚Äúgame over‚Äù.

**How it works:** Uses WebSockets (with fallback if the browser doesn‚Äôt support them) to send and receive data continuously.
